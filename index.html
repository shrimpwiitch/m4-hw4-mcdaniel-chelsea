        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Mucha was born 24 July 1960 in a province in the Austrian Empire.
            As a child, he was encouraged to take up a musical career, but around age 25,
            he began to follow his passion for fine arts like painting.
            Recognition of his work began when he created illustrations Parisian magazines,
            earning him a regular income. As time went on, his work expanded into
            advertising, where he created commercial art like posters and calendars.
            However, in his later years, as Nazi Germany began to threaten Czechoslovakia
            in the 1930s, he was arrested and interrogated, which accelerated his decline
            in health, leading to his death on 14 July 1939.

        <p>Mucha's most notable style was known as Art Nouveau, a French term meaning
            "New Art". Art Nouveau designs were inspired by nature, and featured
            flowing lines, repeating rhythms, and asymmetry.
